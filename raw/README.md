Data was sequenced together with CEL-seq data from Anika Neusch who demultiplexed it.
Copied from 
/local/users/aneusch/experiments/bulk/20200604_Alison/datain/
to
/fast/AG_Junker/aneusch/dataExchange/20200605_bulkSeq_RonnyAlison/datain/
and I copied it here

Anika noticed that some barcodes were missing reads and some unknown barcodes picked up reads.


* celSeq-barcodes_sampleNumbers.txt is the file from Anika with the barcodes that should have been used for sample prep, and that she used for demultiplexing.
