# Scripts

This folder contains scripts, rules, functions and other code chunks that are used in the snakemake main pipeline, and in the notebooks.

## snakemake rules

I have copied some snakemake rules from Wolfgang's scipipline https://github.com/BIMSBbioinfo/scipipeline to adapt and learn how to code more cleanly.

* fastqc.snakefile
* pathmaniputations.snakefile comes from wolfgang's atac.snakefile
