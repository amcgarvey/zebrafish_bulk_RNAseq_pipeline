# Analysis of RNA-seq from zebrafish cardiomyocytes

This is the analysis of RNA-seq data generated from zebrafish cardiomyotes, sorted by Anne Merks from Daniela Panakova's lab and libraries prepared and seuqenced with CEL-seq protocol by Ronny Schaefer from Philipp Junker's lab.

## Project structure

### directories
data/ contains all processed data generated from the analysis pipeline (main.snake) e.g. fastq, bam
notebooks/ are the records of interactive analyses of data generated by the pipeline. Main analysis description in main notebook file and labnotes (dated)
raw/ raw data from the sequencer that is not to be touched
scripts/ functions or bits of code used in main pipeline or analysis notebooks e.g. snakemake rules or R functions

### files
* install_packages.r details all the r packages to be installed
* labnotes.md is the dated analysis "diary"
* main.snake is the master snakemake file for the standard mapping pipeline
* manifest_rnaseq.scm is the guix manifest describing all the packages in the environment
* notebook.ipynb is the notebook describing the main downstream analysis steps. Tests, or versions of these are found in notebooks/ directory
* start_notebook.sh is the script to submit jupyternotebook launcher as a cluster script
