# Analysis of bulk RNA-seq from zebrafish

This is a snakemake pipeline for the analysis of RNA-seq data generated from zebrafish cardiomyotes, prepared and sequenced with CEL-seq protocol.

## Project structure

### directories
data/ contains all processed data generated from the analysis pipeline (main.snake) e.g. fastq, bam

notebooks/ are the records of interactive analyses of data generated by the pipeline

raw/ raw data from the sequencer that is not to be touched

scripts/ functions or bits of code used in main pipeline or analysis notebooks e.g. snakemake rules or R functions

### files
* main.snake is the master snakemake file for the standard mapping pipeline
* 
* pansnakemake_environment.yml is the conda environment used for the snakemake pipeline
* samplesheet.tsv contains all sample names and fastq paths
* samplesheet_aligning.tsv contains paired information for samples paired-end sequenced
* snake_run.sh script for job submission to the Grid Engine cluster
